    <h2>What is a healthy diet?</h2>
    <p>The fundamental principle to a healthy diet
         comes down to one word; balance. Many other 
         factors are included to ensure a balanced diet,
          but essentially eating enough food that
           provides the range of nutrients your body requires encourages the promotion of
            good health. It is important to ensure this variety of foods, guaranteeing a broad 
            range of the nutrients, vitamins and minerals that your body needs. 
            When you are receiving too little or too much of certain elements, this can result in 
            health problems. That is why moderation and control of your diet is important. For example, 
            fats are a necessary part of your diet, but when they exceed the body’s required amount, 
            it can be stored in the body, potentially causing problems, most importantly cardiovascular issues. </p>

            <h2>How can you benefit from a healthy diet?</h2>
            <p>Eating a healthy diet most obviously will assist you in losing weight, but healthy eating has many other benefits. Changing your diet can significantly improve your general health, tackling diseases associated with heart conditions and cholesterol, as well as aiding diabetes, types of cancers, and even depression. Those who eat a balanced and healthy diet are generally 
                considered to live longer lives because of these health benefits. Diet changes can also boost energy levels as high sugar and fat based foods are generated into energy quickly and so run out quickly, leaving us fatigued. Healthier foods release energy at a slower rate, producing a slower and more sustainable release of energy over a longer period of time. Healthy eating can not only improve your body but can change your mood; making you feel more positive and more relaxed, particularly when combined with
                 exercise. </p>
                 <h2>What is the relationship between eating healthily and calories?</h2>
                <p>Calories are your body’s source of fuel. We need to refuel our energy supply by eating food, yet many diets 
                    have branded calories as our enemy 
                    for weight, yet calories are a necessary part of our lives. 
                    A regular man should aim for around 2500 calories, and a woman 
                    around 2,000 calories per day for a healthy diet, unless trying to
                     lose weight. Generally high calorie foods indicate a higher amount of salt, sugars or fat, 
                     yet some foods that are naturally high in calories are a useful, nutritious inclusion to a healthy diet. Corn, nuts, 
                     avocados, olive oil, and whole grain breads are all calorie-rich but beneficial foods, providing a variety of nutrients needed in your diet and also 
                     provide long lasting satisfaction to other healthy foods that fail to fill you up. </p>
